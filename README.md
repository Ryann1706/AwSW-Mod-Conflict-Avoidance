# AwSW-Mod-Conflict-Avoidance

This mod requires MagmaLink on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jakzie2/awsw-magmalink) or the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2594080243).

With there being more and more mods being made for AwSW, and only so many places mods can start from, there are going to be mods that conflict with each other.

This utility mod aims to fix that, by allowing you to choose which mod you’d like to play, instead of it automatically playing whichever happens to be first.
